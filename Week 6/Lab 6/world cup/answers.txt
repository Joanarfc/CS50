Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Based on the time results above, as the number of simulations increases, the general predictions remain consistent, although there may be slight variations in the rankings and probabilities assigned to each team due to the random nature of the simulations, the overall trends and the identification of top-performing teams remain relatively stable.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
It seems like the predictions become relatively stable after 10000 simulations. But, the decision of whether 10000 simulations are "good enough" depends on the specific context and requirements of the application.
